# ADALINE-Algorithm-and-Practical-Examples

## Adaline.m
This file contains the Adaline Algorithm in it's stochasthic, mini badges and badges form. This one is just an example of how Adaline works and 3 different ways to work with it.
We can see the results below in figure 1.

## Adaline_Audio_Filter.m
In this project we use Adaline algorithm as an Audio Filter where we load an audio, adding noise to it, and filtering with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). We can see the process in the graphics shown in figure 2.

## Adaline_DV.m
This work consists of combining hardware as input for the ANN by usign an Arduino UNO conected to MATLAB and a voltage difference circuit shown in figure 3.
Once we get the data, we make a linear regression with Adaline and we get the results as in figure 4.

## Adaline_LM35.m
In this case, we are using the data that we are getting while using the LM35 sensor and predicting the next output in real time, filtering all the data to get an accurate result as we can see in the figure 5.
